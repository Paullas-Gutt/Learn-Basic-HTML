Learning HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a great starting point for web development. Here are some lessons to help you get started with HTML:

1. Introduction to HTML:
   - Understand the purpose and structure of HTML.
   - Learn about HTML tags, elements, and attributes.

   - Learn how to create the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections of an HTML document.
   - Understand the role of the `<meta>` tag for specifying character encoding and viewport settings.

3. Working with Text:
   - Learn how to use headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and line breaks (`<br>`) to structure and format text.
   - Explore text formatting options such as bold (`<strong>`) and italic (`<em>`).
   - Understand how to create links (`<a>`) and anchor tags (`<a href="#section">`) to navigate within a document.

4. Working with Images and Media:
   - Learn how to insert images (`<img>`) into an HTML document and set attributes like source (`src`) and alt text (`alt`).
   - Understand how to embed multimedia content such as videos (`<video>`) and audio (`<audio>`) using HTML5.

5. Creating Lists:

   - Learn how to create list items (`<li>`) within each list type.

6. Building Tables:

10. CSS and Styling:
    - Gain an understanding of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and how it works alongside HTML for styling web pages.

Remember to practice regularly by creating HTML projects and experimenting with different elements and attributes. Online resources like Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) and W3Schools provide comprehensive HTML documentation and tutorials that can further assist your learning journey.
